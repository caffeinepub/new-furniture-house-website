  "summary": "REQ-1, REQ-3, and REQ-4 appear implemented via new hash routing utilities/hook plus new AdminAccessBlocked and NotFound pages, and App.tsx switching views by parsed hash routes. REQ-2 (updating all in-app navigation controls to set the URL hash) is not clearly evidenced in the diff summary beyond App-level navigation helpers; Header/Footer and other navigational transitions are not shown as updated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update all in-app navigation that currently uses setCurrentView(...) (Header/Footer buttons and any other view transitions) to also update the URL hash to the corresponding route so users can bookmark/share pages; browser Back/Forward should move between views correctly.",
      "reason": "While App.tsx introduces navigateToRoute(...) helpers and useHashRoute() supports hashchange events, the diff summary does not show modifications to Header/Footer (or other components) to ensure their navigation controls actually update window.location.hash instead of in-memory state. The modified Header/Footer files are only mentioned in a high-level summary file, not as actual diffs, so implementation evidence is insufficient.",
