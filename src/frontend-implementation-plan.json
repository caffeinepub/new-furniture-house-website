        "The mobile menu Admin Panel entry uses the same deep pink button styling and remains readable.",
        "Hover/active/focus states preserve deep pink styling and include an accessible focus indicator.",
        "When `isAdmin === false`, the Admin button is not shown (existing access logic remains unchanged)."
