      "text": "Update the Admin navigation entry in the header so that when the current user is an admin, the Admin Panel entry point is rendered as a clear, high-visibility deep pink button (not a subtle/ghost link). Apply this styling for both the desktop navigation and the mobile menu entry.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When `isAdmin === true`, the header shows an \"Admin Panel\" button with a deep pink background (e.g., hex #FF1493 or equivalent Tailwind arbitrary color) and readable high-contrast text.",
        "The desktop header Admin button is visually distinct from other nav items (not `variant=\"ghost\"`) and is immediately noticeable.",
        "The mobile menu Admin Panel entry uses the same deep pink button styling and remains readable.",
        "Hover/active/focus states preserve deep pink styling and include an accessible focus indicator.",
        "When `isAdmin === false`, the Admin button is not shown (existing access logic remains unchanged)."

  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui (shadcn components are read-only).",
    "Keep existing admin access control behavior (Admin Panel route remains restricted to admins)."

  "nonGoals": [
    "Changing admin authorization rules or backend admin detection logic.",
    "Adding new admin features inside the Admin Panel page.",
    "Changing the routing scheme (hash routes) for the Admin Panel."
